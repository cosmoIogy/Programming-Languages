        <!-- Now we will learn some Javascript code to perform actions. HTML code mainly for markup (apperance) -->
         <!-- script>
            console.log("Hello World!!")
         </script-->

         <!-- It is somewhat outdated to write javascript code directtly into an html file. It is custom to put all javascript code
          in a seperate file and link it to an html file. Comment the previous code and lets do it. -->
        
          <p><h2>Button Counter:</h2></p>
          <h2 id="counter">0</h2>
          <input type="button"
          value="INCREMENT" onclick="incre()">

          <input type="button"
          value="RESET" onclick="reset()">

          <input type="button"
          value="SAVE" onclick="save()">
        
          <script src="./feb23.js"></script>
          <!--
          Put script tags last in an html doc -->

          <!--
          In Class Exercises:
          
          1. Add a function and button that will reset the counter back to 0 consistently so that the other button still works 
          properly

          2. Add a third button and function that will save the current count to another tag by concatenating strings it, seperated by dashes.
          And works consistently with the other two buttons.
